            The Adventist University of Central Africa (AUCA) was founded in 1978. The official
            opening took place on 15 October 1984 and the university had its definitive operating
            license via the law n0 0056/05 of 3rd February 1988, granting AUCA the legal personality
            as a nonprofit making association. At its inception, the University was located at
            Mudende, former Mutura Commune, Gisenyi Prefecture. Until 1994, just before the
            genocide against the Tutsi, the AUCA had 7 faculties:

            </li>
            <li>
            Faculty of Sciences

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Following the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi, AUCA temporarily suspended its activities.
            From 7 May 1996, University relocated to Kigali City, and reopened a transition Campus
            at Gishushu, Rukiri III, Remera Sector, Kacyiru District. From that time, the University
            operated with only four faculties: Business Administration, Information Technology,
            Education, and Theology.

            In 2019, the Faculty of Health Sciences was introduced, operating on its Nursing campus
            in Karongi District. Until today, AUCA has enjoy a good reputation locally and regionally
            for its track record in quality teaching. Currently the university operates on three
            beautiful campuses of Masoro, Gishushu (Kigali City) and Ngoma (Karongi District in the
